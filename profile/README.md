## A great optimization kit
Cleaning is the main function of CCleaner Professional. With a quick scan it detects unnecessary Windows files and applications you have installed, and helps you to remove them simply and effectively.

The CCleaner Professional Registry section is devoted to verify the integrity of Windows Registry, the file containing the system configuration. CCleaner Professional scans the registry for more than a dozen types of errors and provides the ability to save a backup copy before carrying out a repair.

CCleaner Professionalâ€™s tool menu contains more specific utilities, such as a quick uninstaller, a list of the programs that start when you launch Windows, and a restore point manager.

Unlike the free version, CCleaner Professional includes automatic updates and monitoring functions that allow you improve your system in real time by eliminating unnecessary files, cleaning the cache, or deleting temporary files. Also, you can decide whether you want to be notified prior to deletion or let CCleaner Professional take care of everything automatically.

## A classic interface
To clean files, simply click on the Scan button and let CCleaner Professional discover how much waste has accumulated. Another click on the Run button and it will clean your disk instantly.

CCleaner Professional scanner can be customized to find and remove only what you want it to. The process involves check boxes, so it can take a little effort at times.

Registry Cleaner works in a very similar manner, and also shows the types of errors that it finds. It is quite technical information, but if something goes wrong CCleaner Professional offers a restoration to a previous backup.

Other tools are equally simple but provide little information. Though, in truth, this minimalism is appreciated - especially when compared with other cleaners' busy interfaces.

## Depends on your situation
The utility and effectiveness of CCleaner Professional depends on what your need. To maintain privacy it is very powerful, but its scanning is not the fastest.

The registry cleaning only helps in rare cases, and is an operation of limited usefulness in recent versions of Windows.

The removal tools are basic but work well, though they can occasionally display incorrect data and obsolete entries that could just as easily be deleted by hand.

In a category as challenged as cleaners, in which it is difficult to find honest and effective programs, CCleaner Professional stands out for its simplicity and effectiveness.
